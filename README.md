# Rest_api_0.1_Demo_Project
Using Postman or Thunder Client, we can understand the usage and working of REST APIs. I created a user route where I can add, view, update, and delete users, and it stores data in a database (here I use MongoDB Compass instead of a file system architecture). I will continue to improve the code and add more features in upcoming projects.

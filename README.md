# Rest_api_0.1_Demo_Project
Using Postman or Thunder Client, we can understand the usage and working of REST APIs. I created a user route where I can add, view, update, and delete users, and it stores data in a database (here I use MongoDB Compass instead of a file system architecture). I will continue to improve the code and add more features in upcoming projects.


This project demonstrates the usage and working of REST APIs using Express.js and MongoDB. The API allows you to add, view, update, and delete users, and it stores data in a MongoDB database. MongoDB Compass is used to manage the database instead of a file system architecture.

## Features

- **Add User**: Create a new user and store it in the MongoDB database.
- **View Users**: Retrieve all users or a specific user by ID.
- **Update User**: Update specific fields or the entire user document by ID.
- **Delete User**: Delete a user by ID.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database.
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling tool.
- **Postman/Thunder Client**: Tools for testing APIs.
